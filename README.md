# go-chase-it

This is the second project in a series of projects within the Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree program. In this project, a skid-steer robot with lidar and camera links is designed using the Unified Robot Description Format. Subsequently, Gazebo plugins are added for the sensors and skid-steer control. Two ROS packages - **drive_bot** and **ball_chaser** are created and launched to then chase a white ball in the Gazebo world.
